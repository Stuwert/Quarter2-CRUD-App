# galvanize-reads-q2

This is the project for my final assessment with the Galvanize g18 program for quarter 2.

## Objective

The goal of the assessment is to create a working CRUD app that contains database calls, read/write functionality, as well as express middleware to manage admin/user access.

### Notable Features

- Express Middleware
- Admin/User functionality
- CRUD routes for two data types
- CSS with 3 page view types.  
- Knex.js to manage database interactions.
- Uses bcrypt to hash and store passwords
- Basic form validation
- Uses cookies/authorization to store create, edit, delete privileges

### Next Steps
